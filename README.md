## Modernize Core Infrastructure by Migrating Legacy BIG-IP Configurations to AS3 with Terraform Cloud. 
- This lab is designed for those looking to modernize their infrastructure and migrate their legacy BIG-IP configurations to AS3 with Terraform. 
- You will learn how to deploy BIG-IP in the AWS cloud using Terraform 
- You will learn how to utilize Terraform imperative resources to set up BIG-IP configurations
- Employ the Journey Tool to transform your current configuration into AS3 format and execute the deployment of AS3 configurations onto BIG-IP using Terraform.
- By the end of this lab, you'll have the skills and knowledge to modernize your infrastructure and take advantage of the benefits of AS3.
