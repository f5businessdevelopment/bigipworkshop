Exercise 6- Deploying AS3 App using TFC and terraform BIG-IP resources
======================================================================
In this exercise, we'll explore deploying AS3 (Application Services 3) JSON blobs using BIG-IP Terraform resources. We'll utilize the configuration we converted from legacy settings to AS3. Once more, we'll employ the same big-pool agent for this task.

Let's examine the `main.tf` file and ensure that the organization is set to STUDENT-XXXX. Please verify your prefix and adjust the number accordingly.

You can confirm your prefix or organization number by revisiting the "day0" section and inspecting the `cloud.tf` file.
```
cat  ../day0/cloud.tf
```

Let's execute terraform now

```
terraform init
```

```
terraform plan
```

```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

You'll encounter this if you haven't removed the configuration from day1, as the previous setup remains intact on BIG-IP.

going back to day1 now

```
cd ../day1

```

```
terraform destroy

```

Now do Terraform apply again

```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Ensure that you validate all the workspaces and confirm that you are within your Organization.

Try accessing HTTP://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:8080 in your browser; you should receive a response from the NGINX backend server.

### Clean UP

Prior to cleaning up, ensure that your workspace is not linked to the big-pool agent. Instead, opt for the Remote option. Also go to the __day0__  directory and run terraform destroy from there.

```
terraform destroy
```
