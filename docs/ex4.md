Exercise 4 - Day 1 Creating BIG-IP objects using TFC and BIG-IP terraform resources
===================================================================================

For Day 1, our focus shifts to deploying the BIG-IP application objects using imperative Terraform resources. The main.tf file contains configuration details where we set up monitors, nodes, pools, and virtual servers using imperative BIG-IP Terraform resources, as illustrated below.

__Note__: You don't need to create this configuration, this is just for reference, file `main.tf` already has that.

```
 # Terraform Configuration for Deploying BIG-IP Application Objects

## Cloud Configuration

cloud {
  organization = "<Your Organisation STUDENT-XXXX>"

  workspaces {
    name = "day1"
  }
}
   
```
Specifies the cloud settings for the Terraform configuration, including the organization and workspace name.

### Required Providers
```
required_providers {
  bigip = {
    source  = "F5Networks/bigip"
    version = "1.22.0"
  }
}

```
Defines the required provider for interacting with the BIG-IP platform.
__Note__: You don't need to create this configuration, this is just for reference, file `main.tf` already has that.
### Provider Configuration

```
provider "bigip" {
  address  = "https://${var.address}:${var.port}"
  username = var.username
  password = var.password
}

```
Configures the BIG-IP provider with the necessary connection details such as address, username, and password.

### Resource Definitions
__Note__: You don't need to create this configuration, this is just for reference, file `main.tf` already has that.
```
resource "bigip_ltm_monitor" "vs_tc1" {
  name     = "/Common/test_monitor_vs_tc1"
  parent   = "/Common/http"
  send     = "GET /some/path\r\n"
  timeout  = "999"
  interval = "990"
}

resource "bigip_ltm_pool" "vs_tc1" {
  name                = "/Common/test_pool_vs_tc1"
  load_balancing_mode = "round-robin"
  monitors            = [bigip_ltm_monitor.vs_tc1.name]
  allow_snat          = "yes"
  allow_nat           = "yes"
}

resource "bigip_ltm_pool_attachment" "vs_tc1" {
  pool = bigip_ltm_pool.vs_tc1.name
  node = "10.0.0.171:80"
}

resource "bigip_ltm_pool_attachment" "vs_tc2" {
  pool = bigip_ltm_pool.vs_tc1.name
  node = "10.0.0.172:80"
}

resource "bigip_ltm_virtual_server" "vs_tc1" {
  pool                       = bigip_ltm_pool.vs_tc1.name
  name                       = "/Common/test_vs_tc1"
  destination                = "10.0.0.200"
  port                       = 8080
  source_address_translation = "automap"
}

```

Defines Terraform resources for configuring BIG-IP application objects such as monitors, pools, pool attachments, and virtual servers.

You can access the BIG-IP credentials by navigating to the https://app.terraform.io  then to your workspace. Click on "Outputs" to retrieve the credentials required for configuring the BIG-IP Terraform Variables Set.

## Create Variable Set as BIG-IP env on HCP Terraform
---
Open https://app.terraform.io in a new tab, then navigate to your Organization and workspace. Click on "Settings."

click on VariableSets we are adding the BIG-IP Env variables for terraform

One by one start adding the parameters __address, port, username, password__ and so on, Ensure that you have selected "Terraform variables."....finally create a variable set

![image](https://github.com/f5businessdevelopment/bigipworkshop/assets/13858248/e7e3045b-32bd-4dbd-a009-3a6cc8e85aa0)


You can copy the variables name from below

```
address
```
```
port
```
```
username
```
```
password
````
You should see the BIG-IP Variables Set displayed as illustrated below. 
We're utilizing the private IP for BIG-IP because our plan involves configuring the Terraform TFE Agent on a VM. This agent will communicate with the HCP Terraform using a private IP connection.

![image](https://github.com/f5businessdevelopment/bigipworkshop/assets/13858248/69215482-fd6e-4fc7-a1d5-f01a36cf0849)

Make sure you are in __day1__ directory by changing the directory to

```
cd ~/BIG-IP-Configs-to-AS3-with-Terraform/day1
```
Before running the `terraform init/plan/apply` commands, ensure you update the Organization in the `main.tf` file with the correct prefix.

![image](https://github.com/f5businessdevelopment/bigipworkshop/assets/13858248/96de93ed-f6d4-48f0-9bcd-6871491418f9)

 

## Setup HCP Terraform Agent

You can verify the status of the Terraform agent named "big-pool" by accessing your workspace settings and navigating to the Agents section. The agent should be in an __idle__ state, and it should have both an __ID__ and an associated IP address.

![image](https://github.com/f5businessdevelopment/bigipworkshop/assets/13858248/e26fe5e4-a578-4482-b18b-00371482383e)


Before configuring the Agent, it's necessary to perform `terraform init` and `terraform plan`. This step is crucial as we need to create the workspace named "day1". This workspace will utilize the "bigip-pool" Agent to communicate with the HCP Terraform. Terraform plan will fail however it will create the "day1" workspace.

Access the Agent option by first navigating to "workspaces", then proceed to "settings", and finally select "Agents".

### Set up the Workspaces to utilize the big-pool Agent in your ORG.

To assign the workspaces  to utilize the agent named "big-pool," navigate to the "day1" workspace and select the "Agent" option under the Default execution mode. Then, update the Organization information accordingly.

- Go to Workspaces

- Click on __Agents__ and select Default execution mode as Agent and update Organisation.

- Click on __big-pool__ to get into a new window

- make sure __Grant to All workspaces in the Org__ is selected and Hit __SAVE__

## AWS Security Group Configuration

--Note__: Make sure you are in us-west-2 Oregon region 

1. Go to AWS Console from the Jump Box browser and select __student-XXXX-f5__ instance
2. Click on the security group go __XXX-f5__ edit inbound rules

![image](https://github.com/f5businessdevelopment/bigipworkshop/assets/13858248/17a6db5b-c238-42f5-b69c-e3fe0821fe70)

3. Update the inbound rule by selecting __All TCP__ and __My_IP__ and save the rule

__Note__ IF security group is not configured terraform plan will fail.
Go to VSCode 

Next, execute the command `terraform plan` to generate and review an execution plan based on the Terraform configuration.

Execute the command `terraform apply` to apply the changes defined in the Terraform configuration and provision the resources accordingly.

![image](https://github.com/f5businessdevelopment/bigipworkshop/assets/13858248/4bddc4ea-01e4-49e3-8fb5-cf2fe0310293)

You can now navigate to the workspace to verify that the day1 workspace is created and the configuration is successfully applied.

To access the configuration on the BIG-IP, you'll need to obtain the credentials from the Outputs section in the HCP Terraform. Click on the F5_ui Public IP or copy and open the same in your browser to log in to the BIG-IP interface.

Make sure to update the Security Group of your F5 instance to include your __My IP__

![image](https://github.com/f5businessdevelopment/bigipworkshop/assets/13858248/3fb0ea02-b227-4640-aa16-a24c5f17fe42)

Navigate to the traffic manager option and proceed to the virtual server. Check the status of the virtual server, pool, and pool members. You should see a green light indicating that everything is functioning correctly.

##Access the backend application from your RDP jump box browser

To access the backend NGINX app, issue the command `http://Public_IP_of_F5:8080` from your Jumpbox browser.

You can omit the configuration for now, as in the upcoming exercise, we'll focus on creating and deploying AS3 configurations using declarative BIG-IP Terraform resources.

```
terraform destroy
```
