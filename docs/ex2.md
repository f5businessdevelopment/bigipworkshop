Exercise 2- Create New Organisation on HCP Terraform
====================================================

At the start, it's important to set up the Terraform Cloud organization and workspace. This prepares you to utilize Terraform Cloud for deploying the initial BIG-IP configuration on AWS at a later stage.
The organization name will follow a format like "STUDENT-XXXX," where "XXXX" represents a unique prefix assigned to each student.
Additionally, a workspace will be generated with a name patterned as "workspace-XXXX," where "XXXX" corresponds to the unique prefix assigned to each student.
