  Locate the VScode icon and click on it. Similarly, locate the browser icon and click on it. Both 
  applications will then launch. Please allow a few seconds for them to appear, especially since 
  you're using RDP

   On the VSCode open a Terminal and change directory to
   ```
   cd BIG-IP-Configs-to-AS3-with-Terraform

   ```
   We're navigating to the directory to ensure we're in the right location to begin interacting 
   with HCP Terraform for deploying the Org and workspace later

7. On the browser, under the deployment tab, click on **Cloud Accounts** and look for the **API Key** and **API Secret** as shown below
We will be using these AWS Secret Keys to authenticate the AWS Cloud to create infrastructure.

   We'll require this information to input as AWS credentials into HCP Terraform, as all tasks will 
   be executed through HCP Terraform.
